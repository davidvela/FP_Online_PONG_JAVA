Final Project  2012: 
# Online Gaming Traffic Evaluation through Developing an  Online Multiplayer Game


C2327F Exchange Programme Electronic and Computing Engineering

Gaming industry is becoming as influential and important as the music and movie industries. However, the quality of service on online games is a hard and continuous task, which has to be taken into consideration for developing online games. To solve and support the growing of the traffic on the Internet and the limitation of bandwidth on the online games this project is focused on the evaluation of the gaming traffic. 

The gaming traffic is affected by a high number of factors. Therefore, previously to the analysis of the network, the technology and gaming features which can affect the network traffic and the techniques used to limit that traffic will be carefully researched. Furthermore, it is interesting to consider and evaluate the motivations of the game designers in the time and the currents games in the market in order to understand better the game features and their impact on the gaming traffic. 

Following the investigation, a simple online multiplayer game will be developed in order to evaluate and test the identified features which affect to the gaming traffic. The game elected is a modification of the **“Pong”**, created by Nolan Bushnell in 1972. The game will be implemented using Java language of programming. These decisions were taken based on the simplicity, portability, performance and, open source of the resources; because the time and the money of this project are limited, therefore it is helpful the use of tools and designer easies, effectives and without cost. Other tool required is a sniffer to capture and analyse the traffic of the game; using the last criteria, Wireshark, which is one of the most popular packet sniffers, is the sniffer chosen.

Finally, through this project, it will be obtained a critical evaluation of the methodologies and techniques used in the game development. Furthermore, a list of recommendations for the correct design and implementation of games online will be developed. In order to satisfy all the requirements of this project, it is needed the knowledge of Java language
